OpenGL SuperBible 7th Edition Examples - How to Build
=====================================================

This source code archive uses CMake to build. The samples also use GLFW library,
which is built along with the samples.  Instructions for each supported platform
are as follows:

Windows / Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
--------------------------------------

Install CMake. Windows binaries are available from http://www.cmake.org/.
Ensure that CMake is in your path.
Open a command prompt and change to the directory where you've checked out the code.

### Build the samples

Open a command prompt and change to the build directory in the source archive.
Type:

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 12" ..

Open the resulting superbible7.sln project in Visual Studio.

The examples will build into the `bin` directory.

Linux
-----

As with Windows, the project uses CMake to create build files. You'll
need to install it with the appropriate method for your distribution. On
Debian-based distributions (such as Ubuntu and Mint):

    sudo apt-get install cmake

You'll also need to satisfy dependencies. In particular, you'll need GL headers
and libs (generally included in Mesa packages) and X11 headers and libs.

    sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev xorg-dev

Once you have everything, you should enter the "build" directory in the source
arvhive and issue:

    cmake ..
    make

The examples will build into the 'bin' directory.

Other platforms
---------------

The code will probably build for other platforms, especially if they are
relatively non-obscure, but nothing besides Windows/Visual Studio and Linux
has been tested. It's up to you to find a capable OpenGL 4.x driver for
your platform of choice. CMake should also be able to build the appropriate
project files for environments such as Code::Blocks and Eclipse, but again,
this is untested.


*Please note carefully: EVEN IF YOU CAN BUILD THE SOURCES FOR YOUR FAVORITE
PLATFORM OF CHOICE, YOU NEED RECENT OpenGL 4.x DRIVERS TO RUN THEM. PLEASE
DON'T PAN THE BOOK BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTER DOESN'T SUPPORT OpenGL 4.x. THANKS*

Running the samples
-------------------

*This part is really important. Please read it!*

Most of the samples require some media files. The media files package is a
separate download available from http://www.openglsuperbible.com and is
rougly 100MB of textures, object files and shader code. Unpack the archive
to the bin/media directory before trying to run these samples.
